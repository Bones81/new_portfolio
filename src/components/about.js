        <p>I come to code from a performing arts background. After graduating from Princeton University, I pursued an acting career, with a focus on musical theatre. After many years and a variety of intertwined circumstances, the time had come to build a second career.</p>
        <p>Enter Code. While I had dipped my toe into coding waters many times, I didn't decide to leap off the high board until January of 2022, when I enrolled in a General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. There I solidified a set of full stack skills and grew in confidence as a developer. General Assembly validated my growing skills by immediately hiring me as an Instructional Associate for the April 2022 version of the same course.</p>
        <p>I was born in St. Louis, MO, grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, and currently live in New York City. I spent parts of five years living and working in Hong Kong as a Christmas season vocalist at Hong Kong Disneyland.</p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of Futurama, Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings films, <em>a cappella</em> music, traveling, nutrition, fitness, urban hikes, country hikes, video games, and sports.</p>
        <p>I hope to achieve meaningful change through my code. Whether that means making your life or work easier, more productive, or more fun, my work can help you achieve your goals.</p>
